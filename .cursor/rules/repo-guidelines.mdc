- Stack: Next.js (app router) + Supabase + Tailwind + shadcn/ui; deploy on Vercel
- TypeScript strict; Zod at boundaries; server actions where trivial
- Components/hooks <150 LOC; prefer extraction over cleverness; early returns
- No TODOs left in code; keep dead code out
- One happy-path Playwright test per shipped slice; docs page per feature
